                    I live and work on Wurundjeri land in Melbourne. I completed a Certificate IV in Information Technology at TAFE before starting a Computer Science Degree at Latrobe University, then switching to the online Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT via OUA. In my spare time I enjoy playing and learning about the making of videogames, hanging out with my two cats and consuming Manga and Anime. I love a good mystery. My biggest motivation for wanting to study in this area was to learn more about how computers worked and how to make them do interesting and useful things. I have experience with a few languages, though I am most familiar with Java and PHP. Currently a member of the IIT Assignment group named Group 16.

                    I’m a 21-year-old Australian, I went to high school in Bacchus Marsh where I lived all my life until this year when I moved to St Leonards. I started university at RMIT city campus in 2018 studying a Bachelor of Science then began doing my studies online just before the pandemic started. 
                </br>
                    This class is one of the final 2 classes I have before completing my degree. A hobby of mine is playing piano and reading horror books, my favourite author is Stephen King. I am doing a Bachelor of Science and have chosen this introduction to IT class as an elective. Probably a silly reason to be interested in IT but one of my favourite tv shows is Mr Robot which is about a group of hackers. This show made me realise how much of the world operates and relies on technology to run things such as the economy and how easily your personal information can be stolen online. I have not had much IT experience except using basic things on a computer like the internet and excel.

                    I'm from New Zealand. I have studied video game development in NZ. I have previously lived in Japan. I used to play rugby league. I also trained in boxing, kickboxing, judo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I enjoy watching combat sports including boxing, MMA, kickboxing, and sumo. I also enjoy watching rugby league and support the New Zealand Warriors.

                <p>
                    I started my interest in IT when I got my first game console. It was a SEGA master system 2. I was fascinated by how someone was able to create these games and how they worked. I studied video game development and have done some game work previously. I eventually moved to Australia and started another carer. While I was living abroad in Japan I decided I would like to move there permanently. One carer pathway that is very available to immigrants to Japan is IT. I decided to continue my studies in IT at RMIT so I could keep working and earning money while studying on the side. I hope to use my degree to move to another country and become a developer. Japan would be my preference as I already speak Japanese fairly well and have previously lived there.

                    I’m from NSW and am currently studying online due to coronavirus. As pets I keep a fish tank filled with guppies and my dog who is nearly 17 years old, I’ve had him since I was six after begging for a puppy every birthday since I could talk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of my pets I enjoy reading, playing games with friends and occasionally working on little games of my own. I’ve worked on and off in construction since I was 16 however as I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized It’s not a career path I wish to continue down. I am studying IT because I’ve always been interested in tech, as a child I would get in trouble for downloading this or that on the family computer. I also used to create very simple little robots using parts given to me by my grandfather (electrical engineer) and parts I tore out of other things like remote controlled cars. These days I enjoy making games in unity and learning more about programming.

        <!--IDEAL JOB-->
        <div class="chunk" id="C2">
            <h2>Ideal Jobs<h2>

                <h3>Similarities between the roles:</h3>
                <p>
                    Almost all our roles require some interaction with clients. An Analyst Programmer needs to consult with the client to aid their evaluation of what needs to be done to create the requested application. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An IT Help Desk employee must determine what exactly the client needs, help them troubleshoot, and find a solution to any IT issues they are having. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Optometrist must instruct their clients how to perform the required actions during an eye exam. They must also communicate their recommendations for a client’s treatment and what corrective measures they should take to aid their eyesight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Analyst Programmer and a Japanese Mobile App Engineer will both require programming skills in multiple languages, skills with collaborative services like GitHub and experience with agile methodology as most software creating companies now follow it.

                </p>

                <h3>Differences between the roles:</h3>
                <p>
                    Many of our ideal jobs have overlapping skills and requirements. The IT industry is broad and diverse however, although the differences between certain roles may not seem immediately clear, they do exist. A programmer may need to know entirely different code languages and design methodologies from another programmer. An IT help desk employee won’t need to know any programming at all, and a network administrator probably won’t need any customer service skill. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Japanese Mobile App Engineer will need to speak Japanese. This is a skill that the other roles obviously do not require. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Optometrist will need special training so they may perform eye exams safely, diagnose diseases, and prescribe treatment/corrective lenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An IT help desk employee will need better customer service skills than the other roles. They will also need the ability to extract information from people who are unable to properly articulate the issues they are experiencing due to their lack of IT knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Analyst programmer will deal with more business orientated software development than the other roles. This will require a deeper understanding of a clients' business needs, their hardware limitations, and perhaps most importantly, their security requirements.
